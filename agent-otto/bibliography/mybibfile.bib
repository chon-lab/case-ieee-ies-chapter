	url = {https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:jas:jasssj:1998-2-1},
	abstract = {This paper presents the main features and some simulation results for the DEPINT system, a multi-agent system conceived to illustrate some essential aspects of a social reasoning mechanism (Sichman, 1995), based on the notion of social dependence (Castelfranchi et al., 1992). This social reasoning mechanism is considered to be an essential building block of really autonomous agents, immersed in an open multi-agent system (MAS) context, i.e., where agents may dynamically enter or leave the society, without any global control. As the adaptation of an agent in such a scenario concerns, dependence relations allow an agent to know which of his goals are achievable and which of his plans are feasible at any moment. This way, an agent may dynamically choose a goal to pursuit and a plan to achieve it, being sure that every skill needed to accomplish the selected plan is available in the society. Concerning coalition formation, this model introduces the notion of dependence situation, which allows an agent to evaluate the susceptibility of other agents to adopt his goals, since agents are not necessarily supposed to be benevolent and therefore automatically adopt the goals of each other. Finally, as regardsbelief revision, the social reasoning mechanism allows an agent to detect that his representation of the others is inconsistent. Because agents' interactions are guided by their information about the others, it is exactly during these interactions that they may detect that this information is either incorrect or incomplete, and eventually revise it.},

	abstract = {Agents frequently collaborate to achieve a shared goal or to accomplish a task that they cannot do alone. However, collaboration is difficult in open multi-agent systems where agents share constrained resources to achieve both individual and shared goals. In current approaches to collaboration, agents are organised into disjoint groups and social reasoning is used to capture their capabilities when selecting a qualified set of collaborators. These approaches are not useful when agents are in multiple, overlapping groups; depend on each other when using shared resources; have multiple goals to achieve simultaneously; and have to share the overall costs and benefits. In this article, agents use social reasoning to enhance their understanding of other agents’ goals and their dependencies, and self-adaptive techniques to adapt their level of self-interest in a collaborative process, with a view to contributing to lowering shared costs or increasing shared benefits. This model aims at improving the extent to which agents’ goals are met while improving shared resource usage efficiency. For example, in a public transport system where each mode of transport has limited capacity, commuters will be enabled to make choices that avoid over-capacity in different modes, or in a smart energy grid with limited capacity, users can make choices as to when they increase their demand. The model simultaneously helps avoid overloading a shared resource while allowing users to achieve their own goals. The proposed model is evaluated in an open multi-agent system with 100 agents operating in multiple overlapping groups and sharing multiple constrained resources. The impact of agents’ varying levels of social dependencies, mobility, and their groups’ density on their individual and shared goal achievement is analysed.},

	abstract = {The agent-based modeling approach is now used in many domains such as geography, ecology, or economy, and more generally to study (spatially explicit) socio-environmental systems where the heterogeneity of the actors and the numerous feedback loops between them requires a modular and incremental approach to modeling. One major reason of this success, besides this conceptual facility, can be found in the support provided by the development of increasingly powerful software platforms, which now allow modelers without a strong background in computer science to easily and quickly develop their own models. Another trend observed in the latest years is the development of much more descriptive and detailed models able not only to better represent complex systems, but also answer more intricate questions. In that respect, if all agent-based modeling platforms support the design of small to mid-size models, i.e. models with little heterogeneity between agents, simple representation of the environment, simple agent decision-making processes, etc., very few are adapted to the design of large-scale models. GAMA is one of the latter. It has been designed with the aim of supporting the writing (and composing) of fairly complex models, with a strong support of the spatial dimension, while guaranteeing non-computer scientists an easy access to high-level, otherwise complex, operations. This paper presents GAMA 1.8, the latest revision to date of the platform, with a focus on its modeling language and its capabilities to manage the spatial dimension of models. The capabilities of GAMA are illustrated by the presentation of applications that take advantage of its new features.},

            One goal of modern computer science is to engineer computer programs that can act as autonomous, rational agents; software that can independently make good decisions about what actions to perform on our behalf and execute those actions. Applications range from small programs that intelligently search the Web buying and selling goods via electronic commerce, to autonomous space probes. This book focuses on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of rational agents, which recognizes the primacy of beliefs, desires, and intentions in rational action. The BDI model has three distinct strengths: an underlying philosophy based on practical reasoning in humans, a software architecture that is implementable in real systems, and a family of logics that support a formal theory of rational agency.The book introduces a BDI logic called LORA (Logic of Rational Agents). In addition to the BDI component, LORA contains a temporal component, which allows one to represent the dynamics of how agents and their environments change over time, and an action component, which allows one to represent the actions that agents perform and the effects of the actions. The book shows how LORA can be used to capture many components of a theory of rational agency, including such notions as communication and cooperation.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) applied to Embedded Systems enable cognitive agents to act in the physical world. However, the application of these systems has been little explored to automate communication during crisis events. With this approach, it would be possible to help collect real-time data and deploy rescue forces in risky locations. This paper describes a decentralized, proactive, and agent-based communication model. To validate the proposal, we applied our approach to a physical prototype of smart city devices. In this scenario, we include the interaction of different MAS in a simulation’s flood scenario. The results show the architecture’s effectiveness in collecting real-time data, providing a reliable, low-cost way to integrate citizens and governments during crises. The architecture is a promising approach for crisis management applications that takes advantage of the autonomous behavior of agents in MAS, improving the obtaining of subsidies to feed systems in smart cities and assisting decision-making.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent Systems (MAS) are groups of autonomous agents that act in the same environment, competing or collaborating to achieve individual or collective goals. Such systems can be integrated into embedded devices to perform tasks that control hardware. The main challenges encountered between Embedded MAS are the connectionless protocols some IoT middleware use for agent communication and the lack of security in transferring messages over the network. Therefore, it is essential to use efficient, safe, and reliable means of communication. This work proposes a connection-oriented communication architecture using secure channels provided by network protocols in the application layer. This work contributes to the advancement of MAS by addressing the integration of email protocols and seeking the development of a customized agent architecture based on the Jason framework to enable secure and simplified human-agent interaction.},

First, we establish the linear convergence of the algorithm in closed systems, in terms of the estimate towards the minimizer, for general graphs and appropriate step-size. Next, we estimate the change of the optimal solution after a replacement to evaluate its effect on the distance between the estimate and the minimizer. From these two elements, we derive stability conditions in open systems and establish the linear convergence of the algorithm towards a steady state expected error. Our results allow characterizing the trade-off between speed of convergence and robustness to agent replacements, under the assumptions that local functions are smooth strongly convex and have their minimizers located in a given ball.},

In addition, heterogeneous agents, in Open Multi-Agent Systems (OMAS), can work in similar or different ends. This might deviate the target system state and lead to a chaotic behaviour. A particular kind of OMAS is implemented based on AGR (Agent/Group/Role) model. This paper proposes a novel Norms-based Controllability approach for AGRbased OMAS (NC4OMAS). Mainly, the proposed approach is divided into two phases: monitoring and controlling. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technique is used for norm monitoring compliance. Also, JAVA Expert System Shell (JESS) is used for norm specification, norm modification and for making inference over norms at runtime. In order to address limitations and advantages of our approach, we summarise the most relevant works on norms-based control according to some comparison criteria we proposed.},

	abstract = {Allowing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to compute the mode of the agents’ initial values (i.e., the value with largest cardinality) represents a highly valuable building block for the development of complex decision-making tasks, as it allows agents to identify the central tendency of data or to implement majority voting processes while considering categorical opinions for which average or median values might not be possible to compute. This is especially challenging in the context of Open Multi-Agent Systems (OMAS), where agents are free to join or leave the network, as in this case the outcome of the mode computation process may vary depending on the current participants to the network. In this letter, we propose a novel OMAS mode computation framework where agents select a value from a finite set of alternatives, and compute the mode via the execution in parallel of a novel average-preserving distributed consensus procedure for each of the different alternatives. We complement this letter with simulation results that numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We identify behavioural features that correspond to runtime improvisation by agents in a MAS organisation and from this analysis describe the OJAzzIC meta-model and an associated design method. We present results from simulation scenarios, varying both problem complexity and the level of organisational support provided in the design, to show that increasing design time guidance in the organisation specification can enable runtime flexibility afforded to agents and improve performance. Hence the results demonstrate the usefulness of the constructs captured in the OJAzzIC meta-model.},

The graph topology is represented by a dynamic undirected graph, assumed to be connected only at an initial time, and the open multi-agent system is modeled via a multidimensional impulsive switched representation. We propose a barrier-Lyapunov-function-based consensus control law that guarantees inter-agent collision-avoidance and connectivity maintenance and, relying on the edge-agreement framework, we establish almost-everywhere asymptotic stability of the consensus manifold. The obtained results are also readily applicable to closed multi-agent systems with edge addition. A numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Ambient intelligence has advanced significantly during the last few years. The incorporation of image processing and artificial intelligence techniques have opened the possibility for such aspects as pattern recognition, thus allowing for a better adaptation of these systems. This study presents a new model of an embedded agent especially designed to be implemented in sensing devices with resource constraints. This new model of an agent is integrated within the PANGEA (Platform for the Automatic Construction of Organiztions of Intelligent Agents) platform, an organizational-based platform, defining a new sensor role in the system and aimed at providing contextual information and interacting with the environment. A case study was developed over the PANGEA platform and designed using different agents and sensors responsible for providing user support at home in the event of incidents or emergencies. The system presented in the case study incorporates agents in Arduino hardware devices with recognition modules and illuminated bands; it also incorporates IP cameras programmed for automatic tracking, which can connect remotely in the event of emergencies. The user wears a bracelet, which contains a simple vibration sensor that can receive notifications about the emergency situation.},

	abstract = {Since many of the currently available multi-agent frameworks are generally mostly intended for research, it can be difficult to built multi-agent systems using physical robots. In this report I describe a way to combine the multi-agent framework Jason, an extended version of the agent-oriented programming language AgentSpeak, with Lego robots to address this problem. By extending parts of the Jason reasoning cycle I show how Lego robots are able to complete tasks such as following lines on a floor and communicating to be able to avoid obstacles with minimal amount of coding. The final implementation is a functional extension that is able to built multi-agent systems using Lego agents, however there are some issues that have not been addressed. If the agents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required to move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning cycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and can be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a multi-agent environment.},

This article aims to perform a systematic review about stress, focusing on the core concepts, psycho-physiological manifestations and health assessment. The study consisted of a search in the databases Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science, using keywords for the English terms “stress”, “concept”, “health” and “evaluation”. We chose as parameter the interval of 1959 to 2014 and thought about this interval due to the conceptual evolution of the stress and the relevance of the references found in the search. After reading and sorting, 26 articles and 22 books were selected for analysis. The results indicated that there is a multi-factorial pattern and influence on the magnitude of responses to stress, with predominance in the manifestations of psychological symptoms. The way the individual deals with experiences and stressor events will determine the vulnerability of his/her system to the occurrence of physical and psychological ailments.},

The analysis developed tried to interpret the notions of social cohesion and individuality action through the intersection and of the process for which they were formed in the thought of Durkheim and the consequences of such events generated by that continuous process. Ours developed revealed us, between other things, that the educational process change inside the society for the promotion of the individuality action and the reorganization of the social cohesion. This let we understand each other the distinction among two types of "Social Solidarity"; the "mechanics or for similarity" and the "organic." Besides, it demonstrares clearly as are built the social relationships culturally inside a society, as currents of" thoughts are formed and they win autonomy in the collectivity, conceiving new ways of they mix.},

	abstract = {In order to construct and deploy large-scale multi-agent systems, we must address one of the fundamental issues of distributed systems, the possibility of partial failures. This means that fault-tolerance is an inevitable issue for large-scale multi-agent systems. In this paper, we discuss the issues and propose an approach for fault-tolerance of multi-agent systems. The starting idea is the application of replication strategies to agents, the most critical agents being replicated to prevent failures. As criticality of agents may evolve during the course of computation and problem solving, and as resources are bounded, we need to dynamically and automatically adapt the number of replicas of agents, in order to maximize their reliability and availability. We will describe our approach and related mechanisms for evaluating the criticality of a given agent (based on application-level semantic information, e.g. interdependences, and also system-level statistical information, e.g., communication load) and for deciding what strategy to apply (e.g., active replication, passive) how to parameterize it (e.g., number of replicas). We also will report on experiments conducted with our prototype architecture (named DimaX).},

	abstract = {Psychology has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to the discipline area of education. Since one of the main aims of education concerns student learning – which is an indisputably psychological phenomenon – we argue that the emerging research agenda of embodied cognition has much to offer educational practitioners, researchers, and/or policy-makers. Although embodied cognition is still in its infancy, the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of the literature provides some thought-provoking recommendations to enhance educational practice or practices, which in turn can bring about student learning more effectively. Consequently, this article will be concerned with the discussion of two issues: first, we provide a brief historical overview that foregrounds embodied cognition, and, second, we outline the educational implications of embodied cognition through the use of some examples significant to education. We conclude with an argument for the importance of making findings in an area we call ‘embodied education’ available to teachers.},

We examine AIoT literature related to sensing, computing, and networking \& communication, which form the three key components of AIoT. In addition to advancements in these areas, we review domain-specific AIoT systems that are designed for various important application domains. We have also created an accompanying GitHub repository, where we compile the papers included in this survey: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/AIoT-Survey. This repository will be actively maintained and updated with new research as it becomes available. As both IoT and AI become increasingly critical to our society, we believe AIoT is emerging as an essential research field at the intersection of IoT and modern AI. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for those engaged in AIoT research and act as a catalyst for future explorations to bridge gaps and drive advancements in this exciting field.},

At the same time, these systems are supposed to be safe and secure, deal with environment dynamicity and uncertainty, cope with external threats, and optimize their behavior to achieve the best possible outcome. This "smartness" typically stems from highly cooperative behavior, self--awareness, self--adaptation, and selfoptimization. Most of the "smartness" is implemented in software, which makes the software one of the most complex and most critical constituents of sCPS. As the specifics of sCPS render traditional software engineering approaches not directly applicable, new and innovative approaches to software engineering of sCPS need to be sought.

	abstract = {The trend in industrial/service robotics is to develop robots that can cooperate with people, interacting with them in an autonomous, safe and purposive way. These are the fundamental elements characterizing the fourth and the fifth industrial revolutions (4IR, 5IR): the crucial innovation is the adoption of intelligent technologies that can allow the development of
              cyber-physical systems
              , similar if not superior to humans. The common wisdom is that intelligence might be provided by AI (Artificial Intelligence), a claim that is supported more by media coverage and commercial interests than by solid scientific evidence. AI is currently conceived in a quite broad sense, encompassing LLMs and a lot of other things, without any unifying principle, but self-motivating for the success in various areas. The current view of AI robotics mostly follows a purely disembodied approach that is consistent with the old-fashioned, Cartesian mind-body dualism, reflected in the software-hardware distinction inherent to the von Neumann computing architecture. The working hypothesis of this position paper is that the road to the next generation of autonomous robotic agents with cognitive capabilities requires a fully brain-inspired, embodied cognitive approach that avoids the trap of mind-body dualism and aims at the full integration of
              Bodyware
              and
              Cogniware.
              We name this approach Artificial Cognition (ACo) and ground it in Cognitive Neuroscience. It is specifically focused on proactive knowledge acquisition based on bidirectional human-robot interaction: the practical advantage is to enhance generalization and explainability. Moreover, we believe that a brain-inspired network of interactions is necessary for allowing humans to cooperate with artificial cognitive agents, building a growing level of personal trust and reciprocal accountability: this is clearly missing, although actively sought, in current AI. The ACo approach is a work in progress that can take advantage of a number of research threads, some of them antecedent the early attempts to define AI concepts and methods. In the rest of the paper we will consider some of the building blocks that need to be re-visited in a unitary framework: the principles of developmental robotics, the methods of action representation with prospection capabilities, and the crucial role of social interaction.},

Since the emergence of the IoT, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technology has been successfully applied in this area, proving itself to be an appropriate paradigm for developing distributed, intelligent systems containing sets of IoT devices. However, this technology still lacks effective mechanisms to integrate the enormous diversity of existing IoT devices systematically. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of the IoT artifact as a new interface abstraction for the development of MAS based on IoT devices. The IoT artifact strictly conforms to the Agents and Artifacts (A\&A) meta-model, and it also adopts the programming model of the SPADE multi-agent platform, providing both a consistent theoretical framework and a practical model for real-world applications.},

            Motivation is a central concept in the development of autonomous agents and robots. This paper describes an architecture that uses a psychological BDI model of reasoning, combined with a distributed multi-level model of motivation. The robot controlling architecture makes use of a generic set of deliberative components plus an environment task-centred set of reactive components that reflect the architecture's embodiment. The architecture has been used in a number of simulated environments and here is used to control a mobile robot. A theoretical framework for motivation and affect is given, and related to the nature of autonomy and embodiment. A BDI model, based on a psychological model of reasoning in a 5 year old child, is described in terms of the nature of motivation and affect within the architecture. Finally, criteria for judging the nature of an agent's motivation are introduced, and used to validate the motivational constructs implemented within the architecture. Experimental results lead to a comparative discussion.},

	abstract = {This paper presents ARGO, a customized Jason architecture for programming embedded robotic agents using the Javino middleware and perception filters. Jason is a well known agent-oriented programming language that relies on the Belief-Desire-Intention model and implements an AgentSpeak interpreter in Java. Javino is a middleware that enables automated design of embedded agents using Jason and it is aimed to be used in the robotics domain. However, when the number of perceptions increases, it may occur a bottleneck in the agent's reasoning cycle since an event is generated for each single perception processed. A possible solution to this problem is to apply perception filters, that reduce the processing cost. Consequently, it is expected that the agent may deliberate within a specific time limit. In order to evaluate ARGO's performance, we present some experiments using a ground vehicle platform in a real-time collision scenario. We show that in certain cases the use of perception filters is able to prevent collisions effectively.},

	abstract = {The past decades witnessed the fast and wide deployment of Internet. The Internet has bred the ubiquitous computing environment that is spanning the cloud, edge, mobile devices, and IoT. Software running over such a ubiquitous computing environment environment is eating the world. A recently emerging trend of Internet-based software systems is “resource adaptive,” i.e., software systems should be robust and intelligent enough to the changes of heterogeneous resources, both physical and logical, provided by their running environment. To keep pace of such a trend, we argue that some considerations should be taken into account for the future operating system design and implementation. From the structural perspective, rather than the “monolithic OS” that manages the aggregated resources on the single machine, the OS should be dynamically composed over the distributed resources and flexibly adapt to the resource and environment changes. Meanwhile, the OS should leverage advanced machine/deep learning techniques to derive configurations and policies and automatically learn to tune itself and schedule resources. This article envisions our recent thinking of the new OS abstraction, namely, ServiceOS, for future resource-adaptive intelligent software systems. The idea of ServiceOS is inspired by the delivery model of “Software-as-a-Service” that is supported by the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The key principle of ServiceOS is based on resource disaggregation, resource provisioning as a service, and learning-based resource scheduling and allocation. The major goal of this article is not providing an immediately deployable OS. Instead, we aim to summarize the challenges and potentially promising opportunities and try to provide some practical implications for researchers and practitioners.},

	abstract = {The rise of robots and robotics has proved to be a benefaction to humankind in different aspects. Robotics evolved from a simple button, has seen massive development over the years. Consequently, it has become an integral part of human life as robots are used for a wide range of applications ranging from indoor uses to interplanetary missions. Recently, the use of social robots, in commercial indoor spaces to offer help or social interaction with people, has been quite popular. As such, taking the increasing use of social robots into consideration, many works have been carried out to develop the robots to make them capable of acting like humans. The notion behind this development is the need for robots to offer services without being asked. Social robots should think more like humans and suggest possible and suitable actions by analyzing the environment where they are. Belief–desire–intention (BDI) is one of the most popular models for developing rational agents based on how humans act based on the information derived from an environment. As such, this work defines a foundation architecture to integrate a BDI framework into a social robot to add “act like a human” feature for proactive behaviors. The work validates the proposed architecture by developing a vision-based proactive action using the PROFETA BDI framework in an indoor social robot, Waldo, operated by the robot operating system (ROS).},

In this project we sought to build a BDI agent for use in the real world for campus mail delivery in the tunnel system at Carleton University. Ideally, the robot should receive a delivery order via a mobile application, pick up the mail at a station, navigate the tunnels to the destination station, and notify the recipient. In this paper, we discuss how we linked the Robot Operating System (ROS) with a BDI reasoning system to achieve a subset of the required use casesand demonstrated the system performance in an analogue environment. ROS handles the connections to the low-level sensors and actuators, while the BDI reasoning system handles the high-level reasoning and decision making. Sensory data is sent to the reasoning system as perceptions using ROS. These perceptions are then deliberated upon, and an action string is sent back to ROS for interpretation and driving of the necessary actuator for the action to be performed. In this paper we present our current implementation, which closes the loop on the hardware-software integration and implements a subset of the use cases required for the full system. We demonstrated the performance of the system in an analogue environment.},

The main idea relies on the fact that users, such as developers and researchers, do not always have access to the necessary hardware and resources. Exposing devices in IoT should impact these persons activities. Then, we present the Resource Management Architecture, where several IoT Objects endowed with sensors and actuators can be added to environments that are represented virtually in the architecture. The IoT Objects become available to be consumed by users through the use of applications. The architecture is composed of three layers: one representing devices, the cloud solution, and applications, and how they interact with each other. We also present a study case for testing the whole approach in a smart city scenario.},

	abstract = {Intelligent and autonomous agents is a subarea of symbolic artificial intelligence where these agents decide, either reactively or proactively, upon a course of action by reasoning about the information that is available about the world (including the environment, the agent itself, and other agents). It encompasses a multitude of techniques, such as negotiation protocols, agent simulation, multi-agent argumentation, multi-agent planning, and many others. In this paper, we focus on agent programming and we provide a systematic review of the literature in agent-based programming for multi-agent systems. In particular, we discuss both veteran (still maintained) and novel agent programming languages, their extensions, work on comparing some of these languages, and applications found in the literature that make use of agent programming.},

Robin Murphy is extremely effective at combining theoretical and practical rigor with a light narrative touch. In the overview, for example, she touches upon anthropomorphic robots from classic films and science fiction stories before delving into the nuts and bolts of organizing intelligence in robots. Following the overview, Murphy contrasts AI and engineering approaches and discusses what she calls the three paradigms of AI robotics: hierarchical, reactive, and hybrid deliberative/reactive. Later chapters explore multiagent scenarios, navigation and path-planning for mobile robots, and the basics of computer vision and range sensing. Each chapter includes objectives, review questions, and exercises. Many chapters contain one or more case studies showing how the concepts were implemented on real robots. Murphy, who is well known for her classroom teaching, conveys the intellectual adventure of mastering complex theoretical and technical material.},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems interacting with the physical world where instant external changes and uncertain events exist. The Internet of Things is a paradigm that can interoperate with a CPS to increase the CPS’s network and communication capabilities. In the literature, software agents, particularly belief–desire–intention (BDI) agents, are considered options to program these heterogeneous and complex systems in various domains. Moreover, fuzzy logic is a method for handling uncertainties. Therefore, the enhancement of BDI with fuzzy logic can also be employed to improve the abilities, such that autonomy, pro-activity, and reasoning, which are essentials for intelligent systems. These features can be applied in CPSs and IoT interoperable systems. This study extends the CPSs and IoT interoperable systems using fuzzy logic and intelligent agents as symmetric paradigms that equally leverage these domains as well as benefit the agent \& artifact approach. In this regard, the main contribution of this study is the integration approach, used to combine the CPS and IoT augmented with fuzzy logic using BDI agents. The study begins with constructing the design primitives from scratch and shows how Jason BDI agents can control the distributed CPS. The study then performs the artifact approach by encapsulating a fuzzy inference system, utilizing time-based reasoning, and benefiting from symmetric fuzzy functions.

One of the key requirements of a cyber-physical device is the ability to sense its environment. Wireless sensor networks are a widely-accepted solution for this requirement. In this study, an embedded multi-agent systems-managed wireless sensor network is presented. A novel architecture is proposed, along with a novel wireless sensor network architecture. Active and passive wireless sensor node types are defined, along with their communication protocols, and two application-specific examples are presented. A series of three experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of the agent-embedded wireless sensor network.},

	abstract = {Miniaturization and cost reduction of hardware components have created a trend in the space industry where the traditional centralized computer is being replaced by distributed computer architecture. However, this trend comes with a cost: the on-board software complexity of the space missions has increased. The complexity has origins in the requirements of the missions where in general, these are coordination and control-related processes. As the coordination and the control of the satellite's activities are not trivial tasks, the Multi-Agent Systems(MAS)-approach has been proposed as a new architectural style due to its distributed nature. There are several existing frameworks for implementing MAS-based applications, however, most of them are neither designed to satisfy real-time requirements nor designed to be implemented in highly-constrained embedded systems. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a new tool for MAS-based applications: A Multi-Agent Framework for Embedded Systems (MAES).\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The framework was implemented on top of a Real-Time Operating System: TI-RTOS, therefore, applications implemented with MAES have realtime characteristics. Experiments have shown that the execution time of an Attitude Determination algorithm is consistent on each call with a variance value of the order of 10{\textasciicircum}5 [s{\textasciicircum}2], demonstrating the predictability of the framework. Furthermore, the user coding effort is reduced as several routines are standardized and encapsulated into MAES' API. However, the predictability and ease-of-use come with a slight cost: experiments have shown that MAES-based applications lead to an increase of 6.7 KB in average in Flash memory and 4.5 KB in average in SRAM memory with respect to its non-agent implementation. Also, the CPU utilization increases as inter-agent communication requires additional processing time, also increasing the power consumption. However, the increase is low as the results have shown that is less than 1\% in average.},

              A popular trend in the sciences of the mind is to understand cognition as embodied, embedded, enactive, ecological, and so on. While some of the work under the label of “embodied cognition” takes for granted key commitments of traditional cognitive science, other projects coincide in treating embodiment as the starting point for an entirely different way of investigating all of cognition. Focusing on the latter, this paper discusses how embodied cognitive science can be made more reflexive and more sensitive to the implications that our views of cognition have for how we understand scientific practice, including our own theorizing about cognition. Inspired by the “strong programme” in the sociology of scientific knowledge, I explore the prospect of an analogously “strong” program in embodied cognitive science. I first draw from Dewey’s transactional notion of “situation” to identify a broad sense in which embodied cognitive science takes cognition, as an embodied phenomenon, to be
              situated
              . I then sketch a perspective I call
              situated reflexivity
              , which extends the Deweyan analysis to understand scientific practice in the same terms, and thereby illustrates what research in line with a strong program in embodied cognitive science can look like. This move, I propose, has the potential of setting up a new inquiry situation that makes more salient the embodiment of scientific practice and that, through this, can help organize our own embodied cognitive activities as we try to make sense of scientific work, including our own.},

Specifically, we identify the appropriate organizational abstractions that are central to the analysis and design of such systems, discuss their role and importance, and show how such abstractions are exploited in the context of the Gaia methodology for multi-agent systems development.},

Despite this substantial body of knowledge and expertise, the systematic engineering of large-scale and open MAS still poses many challenges. Researchers and engineers still face fundamental questions regarding theories, architectures, languages, processes, and platforms for designing, implementing, running, maintaining, and evolving MAS.

	isbn = {9798400704864},
	abstract = {Autonomy requires adaptability and persistence in pursuing long-term objectives within evolving contexts. While BDI agents can cope with dynamic and uncertain environments, their adaptability is typically constrained by static action repertoires, known a priori by designers. Through Semantic Web and Web of Things technologies, machine-readable action descriptions can be discovered in hypermedia environments, and updated dynamically to mirror the evolving landscape of actions offered by real-world environments. This paper proposes the integration of action-oriented BDI reasoning with signifiers that reveal information about action possibilities that may appear, disappear, or be modified in a hypermedia environment at any time. We extend the means-end reasoning of BDI agents with a mechanism for resolving signifiers discovered at run time into actions, which enables agents to adjust their decision-making based on action possibilities advertised in the environment. We evaluate our approach through experiments, where Jason agents discover signifiers expressed with available Web ontologies. The results demonstrate that our signifier resolution mechanism enhances action reasoning at run time towards effective goal achievement in dynamic and unknown environments.},
